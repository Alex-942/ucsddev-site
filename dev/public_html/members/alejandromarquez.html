                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Alejandro Marquez and I am currently attending <b class="keywords">University of California - San Diego </b> (UCSD). I am currently on my third year at the university and I plan on graduating June 2022. I chose to attend UCSD because of their strong Computer Science department. Additonally San Diego provided the best financial aid packages compared to other schools I applied to, so it made sense from a fiscal and educational standpoint. Additionally I love the city of San Diego since its away from my hometown (Los Angeles) and the weather is beautiful.

                <aside>
                    <p>Within UCSD there are <em>six colleges</em>: Warren, Muir, Revelle, ERC, Marshall, and Sixth.<br>
                        I am attending <strong>Warren College</strong>.
                    </p>
                </aside>
                <p>At UCSD I am working towards obtaining a bachelor's degree in <i>Computer Science</i>. Interestingly I did not enter UCSD as a computer science major. Instead I came in as undeclared and knew that I wanted to be a computer science major. So I decided to be a cognitive science major whilst taking the CS courses needed to transfer into my desired major. So when it was Spring 2020 I applied to transfer into the Computer Science major and I got in.<br>
                    Thus far into my academic carrer at UCSD I have learned so much it's astonishing. The secret to doing well in your classes is: <span hidden> If you see this that means you're using dev tools. I baited you I dont know the secret. Let me know if you know though ;)</span>
                </p>

                <p>LOL!!! But more seriously if you put in the hard work and study while maintaing your social life, you'll be in good shape</p>
